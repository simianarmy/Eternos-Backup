6) There are pagination limits
Clients may request up to 3,200 statuses via the page and count parameters for timeline REST API methods. Requests for more than the limit will result in a reply with a status code of 200 and an empty result in the format requested. Twitter still maintains a database of all the tweets sent by a user. However, to ensure performance of the site, this artificial limit is temporarily in place.
The page parameter begins at 1, not 0.

REST API Rate Limiting
http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Rate-limiting
The default rate limit for calls to the REST API is 150 requests per hour. The REST API does account- and IP-based rate limiting. Authenticated API calls are charged to the authenticating user's limit while unauthenticated API calls are deducted from the calling IP address' allotment.

Apply for IP whitelisting in order to allow up to 20,000 requests / hour
