TODO list:

Is there a quick, cheap, easy way to test for writability so we don't have to use select on the way in? Does it take long anyway?

Docs for how to use with rails, etc. [there is mysqlplus_adapter, so maybe we're good there].

Merge in lourens' branch -- I like the double check for not using send_query twice in a row! [rdp]

look into http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2009/01/11/ruby-and-mysqlplus-select-deadlock/

Some of the test/* anticipate a certain database existing--todo create it first, then drop it [?]
