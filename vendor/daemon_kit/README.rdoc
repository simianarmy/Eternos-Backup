== Description

Daemon Kit aims to simplify creating Ruby daemons by providing a sound application skeleton (through a generator), task specific generators (jabber bot, etc) and robust environment management code.

Using simple built-in generators it is easy to created evented and non-evented daemons that perform a multitude of different tasks.

Supported generators:

* Evented and non-evented Jabber Bot (coming next)
* Evented and non-evented loops (coming soon)
* Queue poller (SQS, AMQP, etc) (coming soon)

* Review TODO.txt

== Synopsis

  $ daemon-kit [/path/to/your/daemon] [options]

The above command generates a skeleton daemon environment for you to adapt.

  $ daemon-kit [/path/to/your/daemon] -i jabber

Use the 'jabber' generator instead of the default one.

== Generators

Currently only two generators exist, a 'default' generator and a 'jabber' generator.

The default generator creates a simple daemon with an infinite loop inside that you can adapt.

=== Jabber Generator

The jabber generator creates a simple daemon that leverages the "xmpp4r-simple":http://xmpp4r-simple.rubyforge.org/ gem to process inbound messages. The daemon will manage the roster and other little tasks, leaving you to provide the hooks for processing messages, presence notifications and subscription request.

=== Cron Generator

The cron generator creates a simple daemon that leverages the "rufus-scheduler":http://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler gem to create a simple cron-lie daemon. Please be aware that this daemon could never be a replacement for the battle-tested "cron utility":http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/cron-guide.xml shipped standard with most *nix distributions.

=== AMQP Consumer Generator

The AMQP generator creates a simple daemon that has all the stub code and configuration in place to help you write AMQP consumers quickly and effectively. The generated daemon relies on the presence of the "amqp":http://github.com/tmm1/amqp gem.

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.6
* rspec (for writing/running your specs)

== Generator Requirements

Depending on the generator you choose for your daemon, it might require additional gems to run.

* jabber - xmpp4r-simple[http://xmpp4r-simple.rubyforge.org]
* cron - rufus-scheduler[http://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler]
* amqp - amqp[http://github.com/tmm1/amqp]

== Install

Currently recommended to stick to the git repo:

  $ git clone git://github.com/kennethkalmer/daemon-kit.git
  $ rake gem
  $ gem install pkg/daemon-kit-X.X.X.gem

Development versions are available as gems from github:

  $ gem install kennethkalmer-daemon-kit -s http://gems.github.com

Stable versions, when released are available directly from Rubyforge:

  $ gem install daemon-kit
